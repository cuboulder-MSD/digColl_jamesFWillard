# James F. Willard Collection
## Description
James Field Willard (1876-1935), was the head of the Department of History at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1907-1935. During Dr. Willardâ€™s time at the University he committed his time and efforts to amassing source materials and promoting historical preservation in the academic community and public arena. His first project, funded by the State Council of Defense, Colorado's Patriotic League, individual citizens, and the University of Colorado Board of Regents, documented citizen and state activities during World War I. In 1918, this collection became the foundation of the University of Colorado Boulder Archives.
